ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! I'm a junior software engineer with a passion for building web applications. I recently completed an intensive year-long full-stack web development bootcamp, where I honed my skills in JavaScript, React, Node.js, and more.

ðŸŒ± Currently learning: Advanced React concepts and diving deeper into backend development.

ðŸ’¡ Always excited to collaborate on projects and contribute to open-source.
